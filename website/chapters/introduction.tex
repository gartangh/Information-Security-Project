Login using eID, assuming that the country has an eID system.

A Belgian citizen, should use his identity card to log in on to the website.
Once logged-in, he could make his vote and save it.
The website will keep a list of all votes, while keeping it anonymous and it will also keep a list of the people that did vote.

The following assumptions are made:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A voter can only cast their vote once.
    \item Every voter has access to an eID reader or is welcome to use a voting system provided by the government.
    \item No proxy voting can be performed.
    \item The network will be available during the voting period without interruption.
    \item The power supply won't be interrupted.
\end{itemize}

The proof-of-concept demonstration website is created using Node.js and the Express package.
For the database MongoDB is used with the \textbf{mongodb} package (\url{https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/}).
To ensure security and encryption the following packages are used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{crypto} (built-in) (\url{https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html})
    \item \textbf{https} (\url{https://nodejs.org/api/https.html})
    \item \textbf{node-rsa} (\url{https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-rsa})
\end{itemize}
