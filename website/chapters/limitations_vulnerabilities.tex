\label{sec:limitations_vulnerabilities}
% What are possible limitations and remaining vulnerabilities of your system?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tables in database with votes can easily be altered by trusted people with authorized access.
    This is no different from the current voting system and this problem has not been solved by this implementation.
    \item Someone can still steal a user's eID and threaten them in order to get their PIN code.
    \item The system, as any web application, can only work if a stable power source and internet connection can be provided to the user. This responsibility does not lie with us, but with the power and telecom providers in Belgium.
\end{itemize}
