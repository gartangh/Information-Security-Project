<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20001"></a>Introduction and assumptions</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >As an introduction to this report, some explanation of the system is given and some
assumptions about the environment is sketched.
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >A Belgian citizen will need to use his identity card and PIN-code to be authenticated on the
website, by using an eID viewer. Once logged in, they can cast their vote and finalize it.
The server behind the website maintains a list of all cast votes in an anonymous
fashion. It will also keep a list of the people that voted. The server will thus know
who voted for which party, but this information will not be saved together in the
database.
<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >The first assumption that was made, is that the country makes use of eID. Each voter must
have their eID card at their disposal, together with an eID card reader. The reader could
either be property of the user or the voter must have the opportunity to use a voting system
provided by the government. Authentication via <span 
class="phvro8t-x-x-120">itsme </span>could be used to facilitate the
process.<br 
class="newline" />The second assumption is that a voter can only cast their vote once. Just like in the current
voting system, multiple votes from the same user are not allowed.<br 
class="newline" />A third assumption is that no proxy voting can be performed. With this kind of system it is
also a lot easier to vote from the hospital, work or from abroad. This eases up the
authentication process a lot.<br 
class="newline" />To end, the network must be available and power supply must not be interrupted during the
voting period. Ideally the system will be hosted in a Tier-III to Tier-IV data centre [<span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">? </span>].
Anything above that would be overkill. For example, keeping a service up and running during
a flood does not make a lot of sense, since the voters will have other things to worry
about.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30002"></a>Services</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >In this section, the six required security services for the online election system are discussed
and compared to the current voting system. These services are confidentiality,
authentication, access control and authorization, data integrity, non-repudiation, and
availability and accessibility.

   1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate">To  ensure  <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">confidentiality</span>,  votes  should  be  private.  The  voter&#8217;s  information
      should be concealed and it must be impossible to track a vote back to its voter.
      In current voting systems, the voter&#8217;s identity is also concealed since he has to
      register his attendance independently of his vote.

   2. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate">In  order  to  guarantee  the  authenticity  of  communication,  <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">authentication  </span>is
      needed.  Voters  should  only  be  able  to  only  vote  once  and  they  need  to  do
      that in their own name. In the current system this is enforced by requiring ID
      confirmation and maintaining a list of voters in the voting offices. Proxy votes can
      be performed in certain cases, but some form of authentication is still required.
      </dd><dt class="enumerate">
   3. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate">To  determine  which  user  may  access  which  resources,  <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">access  control  /</span>
      <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">authorization </span>is enforced. People who have no voting rights should not be able
      to vote. Their login attempts can be revoked or their votes can be ignored at the
      server side. Furthermore, the votes must be placed within a certain time frame. It
      must be impossible to cast a vote outside of the assigned time span. Again, this
      can be done on the client side by revoking login attempts or at the server side
      by ignoring early and late votes. Currently, all of this is achieved by maintaining
      a list of allowed voters in the voting offices and opening and closing the office at
      certain points in time.
      </dd><dt class="enumerate">
   4. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate">To ensure <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">data integrity</span>, cast votes should be final and unchangeable. Votes
      also  should  only  be  counted  once.  In  the  current  system  this  is  enforced  by
      multiple assignees who are appointed to monitor the cast voting ballots.
      </dd><dt class="enumerate">
   5. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate"><span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">Non-repudiation</span>: Voters should be able to prove they have cast a valid vote. In
      the current system, this is done by providing a stamp when voted. The online
      system will provide the user with a certificate when they have voted validly. This is
      done in 3 steps. First, a certificate is created with the user&#8217;s credentials. Secondly,
      it is signed with the private key of the server. Finally, it is encrypted using the
      user&#8217;s  public  key.  It  can  then  be  printed  by  the  user  or  stored  digitally  on  his
      personal device.
      </dd><dt class="enumerate">
   6. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate">The  voting  procedure  should  be  <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">available  </span>and  <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">accessible  </span>for  all  legitimate
      voters. In the current system this is done by providing multiple voting locations
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
      and  options  for  people  who  are  obstructed.  The  online  system  will  use  a
      decentralized  approach  to  decrease  the  chance  on  failures  and  increase  the
      chance of resisting an attack. Supervised, public computer spaces should also
      be provided for people who have no personal access to the online voting service.
      These should be configured to not save any personal information of the voters
      and should allow voting to happen in a closed-off environment. The time frame in
      which votes can be cast can be lengthened, since there will be no need to count
      votes manually afterward.</dd></dl>

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-40003"></a>Attacks and their countermeasures</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >During other elections (such as the American elections) a lot of stipulations where made
about possible attacks of the Russians in order to change the outcome of the elections.
This system should of course be designed to prevent such things from happening.
There are different possibilities to attack this system and different ways to cope with
them. They are discussed below in two categories, namely passive versus active
attacks.
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-50003.1"></a>Passive attacks</h4>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >First of all, the system should prevent <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">eavesdropping</span>. Allowing attackers to intercept
votes would compromise anonymity and could lead to intermediate results leaking
in order to influence other voters. Preventing this type of attack is done by using
Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt cast votes as they are transmitted to the
server.
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >The second type of passive attacks, <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">traffic analysis attacks</span>, can be ignored since everyone
knows at what time public elections take place. An attacker that analyses the traffic
of a home, city, province, etc. will be limited to observing encrypted messages
going back and forth like expected, but they will not be able to do anything with that
information.
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-60003.2"></a>Active attacks</h4>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >A first active way to attack the system could be by <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">message insertion/modification</span>.
Someone could for example change the transmitted vote of a person from party A to party B.
This is also avoided by using TLS. As the traffic is encrypted and the signatures have to
match, it is very hard to modify messages between transmission at the client and
registering the vote at the server. Because TLS uses SHA2 or higher, the chance of a
random generated signature to collide with the signature of a message is very
low.
<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">Impersonation/masquerade </span>is a second type of active attacks. In this case, a malicious
third party could pretend to be other voters with the goal of voting on their behalf. This attack
should be mitigated by the use of the eID readers: a digital signature can be created with the
private key of the eID to authenticate the voter. Though there still exist risks, e.g.
extortion or threatening of the user by an attacker, deploying this countermeasure will
assure that the connecting user is in possession of the eID card of the voter in
question and knows their pin. This will rule out the most common and large scale
attacks.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >Active <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">replay attacks </span>are a third possible issue, as an attacker could replay the
vote itself. Without a solid solution for this problem, extra votes could be inserted
in the database and voting results could be severely skewed. Fortunately, TLS
has this covered as well. It blocks replay using Message Authentication Codes
(MACs). On the server side, packages of persons that voted before could also be
dropped.
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Fourthly, the system could be flooded by a <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">(Distributed) Denial of Service ((D)DoS) attack</span>
which could cause the services to crash. First of all, a Tier-III data center can handle quite
some traffic. Secondly, the website will be protected with a (D)DoS protection service, which
should filter invasive messages of that kind.
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >A fifth, technical attack could be an attacker <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">hijacking </span>the connection between the user and
the website. If an attacker takes over the connection after the user is logged in, they could
cast a vote on behalf of that user. Again, TLS solves this threat, because the connection is
encrypted. The attacker will not be able to generate the right packets in order to continue the
communication.
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >A more technical attack would be the <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack</span>. In this case, the
attacker makes a fake copy of the website, where a user can log in as well. This fake website
could then pass trough the credentials and set up the connection to the legitimate website.
Once connected, the attackers can cast a vote in their name: the user will think they have
voted but the vote was really cast by the attackers. This is difficult to mitigate, as the average
voter is not well educated to see and avoid those websites. For this reason, TLS 1.3 could be
used in order to try to avoid this in the first place. TLS 1.3 blocks connections if a website is
not legitimate. Another way to avoid users surfing on the attackers&#8217; websites is to educate
the voter through the voting ticket they received. This could warn them about the
aforementioned issue and could contain a QR-code to redirect the user to the official
website.<br 
class="newline" />The <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">man-in-the-browser (MITB) attack </span>is a related attack, where client-side malware could
alter the voting page and cast another vote than the user specified. Apart from encouraging
the use of a safe browser, e.g. Chrome, or anti-virus software, this risk is hard to combat for
all of the users.
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >Attacks that are even more challenging to counter, are the ones that use <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">social</span>
<span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">engineering</span>, e.g. <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">phishing</span>. These attacks are made less likely because the system expects
the user to use their eID card reader in order to log in. Without the eID card, it is difficult to
get the access token to log in to the system.
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >A last possible threat would be that the servers are compromised. Since Forward Secrecy
(FS) is mandatory in TLS version 1.3, not all messages can be decrypted at once in case the
private key of the server is available to a hacker [<span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">? </span>].

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Many of the imminent risks of an online voting can be eliminated, yet the system
described in this report has some flaws. These flaws will be further looked into in this
section.
<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >Firstly, just like in the current voting system, trusted people with authorized access to the
votes can easily modify them and thus alter the results. Whereas social control prevents such
things from happening in the current system, the online system has no constructions to
prevent this. A server admin could alter the voting database without anyone ever
knowing. This is of course a huge issue that has not been mitigated by the designed
system.
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >As mentioned in the previous section, a second vulnerability is the use of extortion
and threatening but also social hacking to acquire a voter&#8217;s eID data. Though the
current system again has some form of social control to make sure the voter is
really who they claim to be when they register themselves in the voting office, the
online system has no way to guarantee this. Biometric identification methods may
come to mind, but these have been shown to not be as safe as one might think [<span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">?</span>
].
<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >A third limitation is that a stable power source and internet connection needs to be
established, like any application would require. By decentralizing the voting procedure to the
voters&#8217; homes with limited power and internet stability, these requirements can not be
guaranteed by the system itself.
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >The database of votes behind the server is an important fourth vulnerability. The system&#8217;s
administrator is assumed not to log the activity of the users or tamper with the cast
votes. In the current election system, this is prevented by having multiple people
providing social control during the voting and counting procedure, such that no
fraud is committed and voting happens anonymously. Having a team of system
administrators in the online system to provide the same supervision would be highly
impractical. If an administrator with malintent or an attacker gains access to the
database, the back-end code could be changed to alter, drop or display the incoming
traffic and thus influence the voting procedure. This would of course mean that the
important requirements like anonymity, data integrity and data confidentiality could be
harmed.
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >Last of all, because a vote and the voter are sent within a single message, an attacker could
store the IP-traffic due to the voting and later analyze and decrypt it. The votes are
transmitted this way to prevent replay attacks and keeping the voting procedure fair, but
interception of this data would compromise the anonymity of the voting. By the way, many
people post their vote on social media such as Facebook or Twitter, which compromises their
anonymity anyway.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5    </span> <a 
 id="x1-80005"></a>Security Mechanisms</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >A small summary of all security mechanisms, used in the theoretical system, is
provided.
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">The Cloudflare&#8217;s (D)DoS protection is used, to prevent (D)DoS attacks.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">eID is used by a card reader or itsme, in order to authenticate the user.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">A Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) connection is set-up using TLS
      1.3.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The RSA encryption, used for the TLS connection, is conforming to PKCS #1
      version 2 and uses the OAEP encryption scheme, the SHA-256 signing scheme
      and 4096 bits. Based on this key, a certificate signing request and a certificate is
      made with OpenSSL.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">SHA3-512 is used for password hashing.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Ideally a distributed database would be used, with technologies such as MySQL.
      It is important that the used technology is able to cope with transactions to make
      sure that each vote is counted and no votes are lost due to concurrency in the
      database. The database should keep track of the votes that have been casted
      and the people that have cast their vote, but this has to be done separately. If the
      votes and voters were stored together, anonymity would be lost.</li></ul>

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >The proof-of-concept demonstration website is created using <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">Node.js </span>[<span

class="phvb8t-x-x-120">Express</span>
package [<span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">? </span>]. For the database, Comma Separated Values (CSV) files are used by the <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">csv</span>
package [<span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">? </span>]. In reality, a transactional database is needed, but this suffices for
proof-of-concept purposes. To ensure security and encryption, the following packages are
used:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">crypto </span>is a built-in package in Node.js, that takes care of basic security for web
      servers [<span

      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span

      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">node-rsa </span>is a package that enables the creation of a public and private key pair,
      needed for RSA encryption [<span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">? </span>].
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The package <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">sha3 </span>is used on the server side to hash passwords with SHA3,
      before they are stored in the database [<span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">? </span>].</li></ul>
<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >The demo of the website starts after going through the (D)DoS protection (such as
Cloudflare&#8217;s Advanced DDoS Attack Protection [<span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">? </span>]) and ends before creating a certificate for
the voter.
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >The differences in security mechanisms, used in the demo website, are summed up
below.
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">As a practical consideration, no eID is used in the demonstration. Instead, testers
      can log in using their UGent ID and the PIN code 9000. This simulates the eID
      token and the passport&#8217;s PIN code respectively.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">TLS 1.2 is used instead of TLS 1.3, since no package was found to support the
      newer version of the standard.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The  RSA  encryption  still  uses  4096  bits,  but  is  now  password  protected
      with  AES256  encryption.  A  public  exponent  of  65537  is  chosen.  The  created
      certificate will remain valid until April 30, 2020.</li></ul>

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7    </span> <a 
 id="x1-100007"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >When designing and implementing the system described throughout this report, there
are many difficulties to overcome. However, current online systems like banking
systems, that are safe enough for daily use, show that overcoming these difficulties is
feasible. Of course, companies always want to be trust by its customers, therefore
everything must work as it should. A lot of recent cryptographic standards have
been proven to be quite secure, and as long as these standards are being used to
implement the security mechanisms, there are no big threats concerning technical
hacking.
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >However, for the online election system, the biggest threat are the humans operation the
system. As a chain is no stronger than its weakest link, the system can become very
vulnerable to attacks because of the voters and operators that use the system. In the
traditional elections, a single person cannot be trusted. Everything is done in a transparent
way by using multiple people in the election chamber, multiple people counting the votes
instead of counting computers, etc. When switching to an online voting system, this chain of
trust gets lost. A person deposits their vote via a black box system that is not transparent at
all, they do not know what is happening behind the scenes and they should not trust the
software just like that. Bad intentions or strong political preferences can be programmed
in the system without the voters even knowing. Beside, attacking the traditional
voting system does not scale well because of the social aspect. The impact that a
single bad person can cause to the results is limited. But if a smart hacker find a
way to bypass the online system, only one person is needed to control the whole
elections.
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >It should also be said that technical issues that can arise during the procedure should not be
ignored. As the widespread issues with voting computers have shown in the past, even
government organized systems appeared not to be as stable as expected. The system
described in this report would go a step further and decentralize the voting to the homes of
the people. As was already mentioned, the limited power and internet guarantees of the
average voter could cause a lot of issues.
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >Though we initially thought online elections showed some potential, listing up the limitations
and vulnerabilities made us realize it would actually be a terrible idea. Even with a well
thought out technological and cryptographic base, it would be impossible for the designed
system to completely fulfill all expectations and match the security and trust of the current
physical election system.
